# FootBallinLine

<h1>Introduction</h1>

Is an example of OOP coding , it was my idea of a new view of Football using by C++ Lenguages . This project was one of all exercises for a future OOP exam 
<br></b>

<br>
<h1>How works?</h1>

The game consists of a football simulation of two randomly created football teams where each team consists of 5 attackers and 5 defenders that clash with each other. We have an abstract class called Player , we use an template as well for future feauture<br>
<br>

<br>


GetAction() method will be the method to return the value of the attack or defense. Its value will be calculated within the constructor of the two subclasses.

<br>
<p>We have two underclass for the Attack and Defence</p>
<br>

In a main you generate two teams of 10 elements, 5 attackers and 5 defenders using the sequence of values chosen by the user. Create a turn-based game where two random elements are chosen ,one attacker from one team and one defender from the other. If the attacker has a higher attack value than the other teamâ€™s defensive value, he scores. The first team to score 3 goals wins

Next Request : 
1) display the collection by overloading the operator <<

2) Average attack and defence

3) Implement member operator overloading [] to perform a transfer in one of the two teams


<h1>NOTE</h1>
The readme is not completed , coming soon <br>

<h1>FEAUTURE</h1>
My idea a good profiling and i 'll make a league
